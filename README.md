ECE Capstone assignment. 
My name is Roy Whitenton. I am an ECE student at Mississippi State University. I am a senior graduating in May. I COOPed at Cooper Tire while at Mississippi State and have worked a few other various jobs before MSU. Not many people know this about me, but I am a licensed insurance agent.
